## Interview Assistant - An AI powered Interview Practicing Tool

This application is designed to help users practice for interviews in a simulated environment. The user can interact with the application by providing audio input, which is then transcribed and processed by the application. The application then generates a response using OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo model, simulating an interviewer. Finally, the response is converted to speech using ElevenLabs and played back to the user.

**Execution Flow**

1. **User Input:** The user provides audio input through a microphone or uploaded file.
2. **Speech Transcription:** The audio is transcribed into text using OpenAI's whisper-1 model.
3. **Chat Response Generation:** The transcribed text is appended to a chat history and sent to the gpt-3.5-turbo model, which generates a response simulating an interviewer's questions.
4. **Chat History Management:** The conversation history is maintained in a JSON file to provide context for future interactions.
5. **Text to Speech:** The generated response is converted into speech using ElevenLabs' ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech API.
6. **Audio Output:** The converted speech is played back to the user.

**Requirements**

* Python 3.6 or later
* ElevenLabs API Key ([https://www.elevenlabs.io/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://www.elevenlabs.io/))
* OpenAI API Key ([https://beta.openai.com/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://beta.openai.com/))
* dotenv library (install using pip install python-dotenv)
* fastapi library (install using pip install fastapi)
* openai library (install using pip install openai)
* elevenlabs library (install using pip install elevenlabs)

**Setup**

1. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project.
2. Add the following lines to the `.env` file, replacing the placeholders with your actual API keys:

```
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=YOUR_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
```

3. Install the required libraries using pip:

```
pip install python-dotenv fastapi openai elevenlabs
```

**Running the Application**

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Run the following command to start the application:

```
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

This will start the application on port 8000. You can then access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:8000/.

**Using the Application**

1. To interact with the application, you can either use a microphone or upload an audio file containing your response to the interviewer's question.
2. The application will then transcribe the audio, generate a response simulating an interviewer's question, and play it back to you.

**Note:**

This is a basic example, and you may need to modify the code to fit your specific needs. For example, you may want to add functionality for the user to select the interview domain or difficulty level.
